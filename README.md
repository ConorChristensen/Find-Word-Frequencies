# Find-Word-Frequencies
All programs use python. Programs work to analyse a text, and use Hash-tabling to output the words respective frequencies. 

splitter.py takes an input text file, and extracts only relevant lexical items, outputing them into splitwords.txt

calcfreq.py takes the splitwords.txt file, and outputs an ordered matrix of the words, and their respective frequencies in the text.
This is completed using a hash table, and noting respective frequencies of words whilst reading through the input file.
